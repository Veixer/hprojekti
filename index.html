			<br>
			<h3 class="text-center">First words</h3>
			<p class="text-center">
				First off, this guide is targeted for those who already know what game is League of Legends and are familiar with the roles. So this is not essentially good guide for beginners. But even as beginner you can still take tips off from this guide. Since LoL is complicated game when moving towards more difficult games and experienced enemies, you really have to know what you are doing. You can't just run head first and hope for the best.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				This guide is to help you decide what champions to play and what style does fit you. I'm not the highest level of player, but I know some stuff pretty well and wish to share my information with you. This guide is also ever-developing. So if you have something to add, let me know via form in the end!

			<h3 class="text-center">Why solotop?</h3>
			<p class="text-center">
				So why one would choose solotop as his/her role?
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				The answer isn't same for everybody. I myself enjoy playing solotop because it feels isolated from others and junglers don't need to gank it when you do well and can force enemy jungler there, giving your own jungler much more freedom to help mid or bottom. With certain champions I'm very confident and can win most lanes. There are many more missions for solotop besides winning lane too! Rift Herald is good objective to get with your jungler and choosing teleport really can change the game for your team. Teleporting to important teamfight, helping dragon or ganking bottom with TP can help a lot. You can also try taking some counter-jungling initiative in enemy upper jungle. This all makes solotop very exciting. Sometimes solotop can feel like second jungler in your team, which is huge advantage.

			<h3 class="text-center">AD, AP, Bruiser or Tanky</h3>
			<p class="text-center">
				There are many different types to choose from. In my opinion most important thing is to learn basic and advanced mechanics of particular champions. The better you handle the champion, the better you can play your lane. I have won multiple times in solotop against my "counterpick". Sometimes with jungler's help and sometimes without. If you know your champion's mechanics better than enemy and have good knowledge of your limits with that particular champion, you are good to go. There are many "one trick ponies" who play just one or few champions and achieve high ranks. This is because they have mastered their champion and can play it well against anything. It is important to learn before going to ranked.

			<h3 class="text-center">About Champions</h3>
			<p class="text-center">
				As you saw little summary of champions I listed, you have probably noticed I didn't include all solotop champs. Yes you can play almost anything in solotop, but these I mentioned are better ones. I myself enjoy a lot playing Trundle. You have to find your kind of playstyle and champions and stick to them. Lately tank and tankyness has been very meta in solotop. Tank-Ekko, Maokai and such tanks have been very often picked there.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				Also some champions can be played many ways. Ekko is usually played as tank, but some people play it as AP. There are many champions that you can play different builds with and they all might work well. I myself have experienced starting tanky as Trundle very good in top. Usually starting with Sunfire Cape and Spirit Visage (order depends on enemy). After those core items I usually go Iceborn Gauntlet or Blade of the Ruined King. Sometimes Titanic Hydra is good option too. Best way to find out these item combinations per champion is to check what other people build (pro players and best win-ratio builds) and experience different builds on different enemies.

			<h3 class="text-center">Early laning</h3>
			<p class="text-center">
				Early laning phase is very crucial in solotop. You can try to get first blood at level 1 depending on your matchup. As example Gangplank can definitely get first blood at level 1 with some creative placement with barrels and outplaying enemy. Sometimes with other champs like Malphite it is better to just try to farm early as much as possible and wait until jungler ganks. Because you can't really know what enemy is up to, you really need to focus on your laning and not pushing over your limits. This is why knowing your personal limits and boundaries is very important!
			</p>
			<br>

			<h3 class="text-center">Laning</h3>
			<p class="text-center">
				Overall laning should be pretty focused on getting creeps and outplaying your enemy with trades. If you lose trade, it's better to watch out for future trades. If it's clear that you are not able to trade well with your enemy it might be better to just stay in exp range and try to lasthit only when it's absolutely safe. If you lose too much health while doing bad trades you end up being easy kill for enemy jungler. Some top laners stop taking farms in hopes of you pushing and then letting their jungler gank you. It is important to ward around and using pink ward for your own side of bush (blue side river; red side tribush). Trade well, get creep kills high and stay safe!
			</p>
			<br>

			<h3 class="text-center">Ganking/Roaming/Counter-Jungling</h3>
			<p class="text-center">
				Sometimes you do well in your lane. You might get few kills without dying, push lane and enemy has to back in fear of getting killed and you are causing overall pressure on their tower. What to do when you can't farm under enemy turret forever and have to do something to not lose too much money or exp? If you took teleport (which is super-recommended for all solotops) you can try to teleport to bottom lane wards or sometimes in rare case, mid. It's easier to walk to gank mid, but it all depends on situation. If you see enemy jungler in bottomlane or bottomjungle, you can try to counterjungle and maybe even take enemy buff from top jungle! You should know our limits so you don't end up dead, but with enough testing your limits you start to get the feel when you can do something crazy like steal enemy red/blue buff and jungle minions. This cripples enemy a lot and can be turning point if their jungler was more succesful than yours.
